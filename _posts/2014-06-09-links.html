title: Fragments of identity
---

<p>
Hello good evening and welcome.  I'm so totally going to make a website one of these days.
In the meantime, here are some fragments of my identity.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Old <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/paulfitz/">MIT site</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://robotrebuilt.com/people/paulfitz/">RobotRebuilt</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/fitzyfitzyfitzy">@fitzyfitzyfitzy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
For the sake of search engines, this is the Paul Fitzpatrick who does robotics and computer vision,
also the <a href='http://datacommons.find.coop'>Data Commons Co-op</a>, also <a href="http://paulfitz.github.io/cosmicos">CosmicOS</a>, and that should be enough.
</p>
