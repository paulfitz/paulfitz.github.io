I wrote [`daff`](https://github.com/paulfitz/daff) to
better visualize diffs between tables (`daff` = data `diff`).
You don't need this if you work with 
append-only data, for example a stream of events
churned out by a sensor or bureaucracy.  But if you
have a collection of assertions than can change with time
or need correcting, then data diffs are handy.

`daff` can be used from that command line,
as a library,
or on github, using James Smith's <a href="http://theodi.org/blog/csvhub-github-diffs-for-csv-files">CSVHub</a>.  CSVHub can convert a 
diff like this:

{: .scale-image}
![bus diff line based](/images/bus_diff_before.png)

to something like this:

{: .scale-image}
