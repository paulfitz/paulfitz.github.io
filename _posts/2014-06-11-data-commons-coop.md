title: The Data Commons Co-op
---

The [Data Commons Co-op](http://datacommons.coop) is a quirky start-up
that I've been helping out with.  Its job is to 
maximize the impact of the data held by its members, and reduce costs
in managing it.  Its members are "alternative economy" organizations 
of all types.  Dan Nordley calls it "perhaps the geekiest of all cooperative 
organizations on the planet!"

The infrastructure for collaborative data projects could be a
lot more fun than it is now. 
Open Data initiatives are pushing things forward quite a
bit, primarily with government data in mind.  That is sort of a
top-down direction of data flow.  We're looking at bottom-up,
grass-roots economic organizing.  Worker co-ops, buying clubs,
community gardens, time banks, and so on.  There's a lot of 
overlap in communities, and potential for network effects.
The Data Commons Co-op is a way to pay for the infrastructure that
every one needs and no-one can make happen alone.
So far we've produced a 
<a href="http://dataprotocols.org/tabular-diff-format/">simple diff format for tables</a> documented on the <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/">Data Protocols</a> site (some background in an <a href="http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2013/08/08/diffing-and-patching-data.html">Open Knowledge Labs post</a>),
along with two programs called <a href="/2014/06/10/daff.html">daff</a> and
<a href="http://share.find.coop/">coopy</a> for comparing and merging
table versions.  Beyond the technology, we're also figuring out
how to a culture of sharing can work in the economy.  There's 
a lot of reflexive data-hoarding and hiding that goes on, which is
totally understandable.  For individual organizations, the cost
of thinking about all the issues around sharing data can outweigh
by far any potential benefit.  Hopefully the DCC can tilt that
equation!
