title: The Data Commons Co-op
---

The [Data Commons Co-op](http://datacommons.coop) is a quirky start-up
that I've been helping out with.  Its job is to 
maximize the impact of the data held by its members, and reduce costs
in managing it.  Its members are "alternative economy" organizations 
of all types.  Dan Nordley calls it "perhaps the geekiest of all cooperative 
organizations on the planet!"

The infrastructure for collaborative data projects is pretty terrible
right now. Open Data initiatives are pushing things forward quite a
bit, primarily with government data in mind.  That is sort of a
top-down direction of data flow.  We're looking at bottom-up,
grass-roots economic organizing.  Worker co-ops, buying clubs,
community gardens, time banks, and so on.  There's a lot of 
overlap in communities, and potential for network effects.
The Data Commons Co-op is a way to pay for the infrastructure that
every one needs and no-one can make happen alone.
