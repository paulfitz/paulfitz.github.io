title: How square am I
---

Let me count the ways:

* <b>My t-shirts say nothing witty</b>.  I'm currently wearing one
emblazoned with an enigmatic logo for a local bike/walk event and
more importantly (if typography is any guide) THE LOGOS AND NAMES OF
ALL ITS SPONSORS.  There's a white stain from some goop my 
daughter spilled on me that I half-heartedly and ineffectually tried
to rub off with my nails.
    * I would like to have witty t-shirts, I'm not avoiding them in some 
hip way. I just sort of don't have them.

* <b>My laptop has no funky stickers</b> from events or projects.
All there is, is a fading Intel Centrino Inside sticker it came with,
that has been gradually
rotating under my hand. It is now at a 30 degree angle, with traces
of exposed glue on the upper side. I don't plan to take any action about
this anytime soon.
    * I would like to have funky stickers, I'm not avoiding them in some 
hip way. I just sort of don't have them.

* <b>I don't have an interesting phone</b>. My phone is as dumb as they
come, and again, not in a hip way, more in a total-neglect and out-of-touchy
kind of way.
* <b>I've never changed my name on twitter</b>. Why are people doing that?
* The <b>things I'm putting on this list</b> and not putting on it
no doubt reveal assumptions I'm making about what is hip
that confirm further my squaritude in ways I can't even imagine.
* <b>I totally get grumpy</b> about the dumb things that kids are doing
these days.
