title: Spreadsheets with python formulas

When doing spreadsheet work, I like [Grist](https://getgrist.com)
(disclaimer, I work at the company that makes it), because it lets me
use [python formulas](https://support.getgrist.com/formulas/).  Once I
know how to access cells and tables, I don't have to remember weird
spreadsheet-specific commands - I can just use python list
comprehensions.

For example, when I wanted to wish someone a happy birthday every day
for a week, it was super easy to import the latest exoplanet data and
do some orbital math in python to see which exoplanets are back in
about the same point in their orbit as they were when that special
someone was born.

It is a simple difference but a real pleasure.

By the way no, I wasn't born in January 8, 1935, that was
[someone else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley).
